      <description>Of all the enacted bills in congress 113 - 117, which party is the original sponsor and in what category? Data is fetched from the ProPublica API.
At first glance, the curvature of the horizontal bars indicate that the Republican party had greater influence in enacting bills to their favor in Congress 114 and 115. It is largely due to the fact that they controlled both chambers of Congress. Therefore, we can see similar counts of enacted bills where there is overlap of interests between the two parties of those years.</description>
