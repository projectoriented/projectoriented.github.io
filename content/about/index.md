Hello :wave:!
My name is Mei Wu (she/her), a Bioinformatician at the University of Washington working with the Eichler Lab. My professional interest is in uncovering insights within the human genome to explain the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders.

Currently, I am living in Seattle, WA. I like coffee :coffee:, baking :cake:, reading about USA politics, and making time for RPG board games (e.g. Gloomhaven).

:cactus: This blog is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), with a [forked](https://github.com/projectoriented/hugo-theme-cactus) version of the Cactus theme.

Thank you for visiting and I hope you have a nice day! :sun::smile:
